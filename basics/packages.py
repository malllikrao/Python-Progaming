#First, we create a directory and give it a package name, preferably related to its operation.
#Then we put the classes and the required functions in it.
#Finally we create an __init__.py file inside the directory, to let Python know that the directory is a package.


# Python code to illustrate the Modules
class Bmw:
	# First we create a constructor for this class
	# and add members to it, here models
	def __init__(self):
		self.models = ['i8', 'x1', 'x5', 'x6']

	# A normal print function
	def outModels(self):# method
		print('These are the available models for BMW')
		for model in self.models:
			print('\t%s ' % model)
# Python code to illustrate the Module
class Audi:
	# First we create a constructor for this class
	# and add members to it, here models
	def __init__(self):
		self.models = ['q7', 'a6', 'a8', 'a3']

	# A normal print function
	def outModels(self):#method overriding
		print('These are the available models for Audi')
		for model in self.models:
			print('\t%s ' % model)
# Python code to illustrate the Module
class Nissan:
	# First we create a constructor for this class
	# and add members to it, here models
	def __init__(self):
		self.models = ['altima', '370z', 'cube', 'rogue']

	# A normal print function
	def outModels(self):
		print('These are the available models for Nissan')
		for model in self.models:
			print('\t%s ' % model)

# Finally we create the __init__.py file. This file will be placed inside Cars directory and can be left blank or we can put this initialisation code into it.


#from Bmw import Bmw
#from Audi import Audi
#from Nissan import Nissan


#Now, let’s use the package that we created. To do this make a sample.py file in the same directory where Cars package is located and add the following code to it:

# Import classes from your brand new package
#from Cars import Bmw
#from Cars import Audi
#from Cars import Nissan

# Create an object of Bmw class & call its method
#ModBMW = Bmw()
#ModBMW.outModels()

# Create an object of Audi class & call its method
#ModAudi = Audi()
#ModAudi.outModels()

# Create an object of Nissan class & call its method
#ModNissan = Nissan()
#ModNissan.outModels()
